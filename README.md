# Budgety
The budget app for maintaining income and expenses.

Overview:

1. The budget application allows us to add incomes and expenses for certain month.

2. The application calculates how much money the user have made and how much they have spent based on the input from the user.

3. It displays the income and expenses separately under different blocks.

4. The expenses even displays in-total and individually how much percent have the user used from the available budget share.

5. The user can even remove any expense or income at their will and the changes would be reflected on the top with total          budget and total expenses.

6. Thus displays the user with the resulting budget in GUI.
